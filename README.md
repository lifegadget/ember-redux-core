# Ember Redux Core
> Bringing the REDUX state machine to Ember


# Overview

This Ember addon is meant to make the transition to Redux easy and straight forward in a manner which _exposes_ everything to the consumer of the addon rather than performaing fancy magic behind curtains. Now I know we all love magic but really magic isn't needed for Redux ... it is powerful AND it is actually quite simple too. Furthermore, the popularity and it's founder (Dan Abranov) have contributed a ton of very good literature and video tutorials to help you grasp the power and use of this state system.

### Standing on the shoulders of giants

Before going any further I think it is worth stopping to say that this addon is another classic example of "standing on the shoulders of giants". Dan Abranov is a well spoken creator and advocate of Redux but he'll never shy away from telling you that the Redux solution takes many of it's ideas from the Elm programming language. In turn I recently heard the Elm creator, Evan Czaplicki, say recently in a podcast that his ideas in turn were taken in part from classic functional programming theories. With this metaphor in hand let me start by saying that this addon was inspired by Toran Billup's [`ember-redux`](http://www.ember-redux.com/) addon. His addon was instrumental in my believing that the cost of using Redux in Ember was containable.

While I had initially hoped that my contribution to the Ember communitity would just be PR's to Toran's effort it turns out that we both plan on being heavy users of our own respective addons (which in my case means I'm stubborn) and some of our views were different enough that it made more sense to go in different directions at least for now. Hopefully this will not serve as a _distraction_ to EmbereÃ±os so much as _optionality_.
